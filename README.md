# DIKU-ACS-EXAM-2015
Exam for course in Advanced Computer Systems 2015/2016 - JAVA programming language


We attempt to touch on many of the learning goals of ACS. Recall that the learning goals of ACS are:
(LG1) Describe the design of transactional and distributed systems, including techniques for modularity,
performance, and fault tolerance.
(LG2) Explain how to employ strong modularity through a client-service abstraction as a paradigm to
structure computer systems, while hiding complexity of implementation from clients.
(LG3) Explain techniques for large-scale data processing.
(LG4) Implement systems that include mechanisms for modularity, atomicity, and fault tolerance.
(LG5) Structure and conduct experiments to evaluate a system's performance.
(LG6) Discuss design alternatives for a modular computer system, identifying desired system properties
as well as describing mechanisms for improving performance while arguing for their correctness.
(LG7) Analyze protocols for concurrency control and recovery, as well as for distribution and replication.
(LG8) Apply principles of large-scale data processing to analyze concrete information-processing
problems.
